                    <div class="subtitle">Searching the Internet</div>
                    <p>This section was a highly informative collection of all the helpful knowhow one needs to optimize their search of the internet. The section taught me about selecting trustworthy sources, search stratergies and the use of search operators and advanced search.
                    <br><br>
                    When searching online we learnt to evaluate the site using the CRAP framework (Currency, Reliability, Authority, Purpose) to ensure the information is trustworthy.
                    <br><br>
                    As for search stratergies, identifying key terms, formulating clear questions and using the 5Ws ensure the information we find is relevant and reduced wasted time in the process.    
                    <br><br>
                    Finally, by using operators as shown in the image, we can completely greatly streamline the search process. The operators can be used to specify searching for information from a specific site, a certian file type and many other criteria.
                    <br></br>
                    While I knew bits and parts of all this, this consolodation of information has helped me solidify my searching skills. I will undoubtedy use these skills further on, be it for a research paper for academic writing, or random question that popped into my mind.

                    <div class="subtitle">Web Basics</div>
                    <p>The web basics section convered the introduction to how websites work and simple web development using HTML and CSS.
                    <br><br>
                    The basic process of how fetching a website works was a part of this section. It starts with a URL entered into the search bar that acts as an address for the website, this is followed by the DNS server returning the IP associated with that name and finally the browser rendering the webpage sent by the webserver.
                    <br><br>
                    The next part introduced us to web development. Guiding us through the setup process and giving us information on some of the main HTML tags and CSS styles. We practiced using HTML and CSS by making and styling a webpage about our bucket list.
                    <br></br>
                    This section was great to revise my web development skills and is one of the reasons I decided to code this e-portfolio instead of using a platform like Wix.

                    <p>In this section we learned about the 4 pilars of computational thinking:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Decomposition 
                            <br>&nbsp Break a complex process down into multiple simpler problems</li>
                        <li>Pattern Recognition 
                            <br>&nbsp Find patterns among the sub-problems</li>
                        <li>Abstraction 
                            <br>&nbsp Determine and filter out the unimportant parts of the problem</li>
                        <li>Algorithms 
                            <br>&nbsp Create step-by-step instructions to solve the problems</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>
                    After learning the process of computational thinking I have been able to apply its principles not only to problems related to programming, but also any complex issues I face in daily life. It's application makes it much simpler to solve problems that I initially found complex.</p>

                    <div class="subtitle">AI Tools</div>
                    <p>AI tools have now become a core part of most peoples workflow with adoption reaching <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/indl-goods/svs/construction/is-ananta-by-avas-wellness-the-next-big-leap-in-alibaugs-luxury-real-estate-market/articleshow/117513298.cms" data-tooltip="The Economic Times" data-flow="right">48% in key Indian Sectors.</a> Therefore, its crutial we learn how to use these tools correctly.
                    <br><br>
                    This section first goes over the significant milestones in the history of AI, such as the term 'AI' being coined in 1956. 
                    <br><br>
                    Next we learn about how AI networks actually function, i.e. through the use of machine learning, neural networks and prediction. Machine learning is split into three categories, supervised, unsupervised and reinforement learning. Each of there categories serve to train AIs with different purposes like pattern recognition or prediction.   
                    <br><br>
                    Finally, we experimented with using AI in academic contexts taking the assistance of ChatGPT to help structure a research paper, provide important points to be mentioned and format citations.
                    <br></br>
                    All of us use AI almost every day. Be it through navigating with Google Maps or by talking to a LLM. This course helped me learn a depth of information about how these seemingly magical systems actually work, and how I can make use of them in academic contexts.
