                    <p>This section was a highly informative collection of all the helpful knowhow one needs to optimize their search of the internet. The section taught me about selecting trustworthy sources, search stratergies and the use of search operators and advanced search.
                    <br><br>
                    When searching online we learnt to evaluate the site using the CRAP framework (Currency, Reliability, Authority, Purpose) to ensure the information is trustworthy.
                    <br><br>
                    As for search stratergies, identifying key terms, formulating clear questions and using the 5Ws ensure the information we find is relevant and reduced wasted time in the process.    
                    <br><br>
                    Finally, by using operators as shown in the image, we can completely greatly streamline the search process. The operators can be used to specify searching for information from a specific site, a certian file type and many other criteria.
                    <br></br>
                    While I knew bits and parts of all this, this consolodation of information has helped me solidify my searching skills. I will undoubtedy use these skills further on, be it for a research paper for academic writing, or random question that popped into my mind.
