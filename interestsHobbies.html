                    <div class="subtitle">Programming and Open Source</div>
                    <p>I have been facinated by programming and computers since childhood. I remember one of my first introductions to programmign being learning basic javascript on Khan Academy all the way back in 5th grade. 
                    <br><br>
                    Since then I've learnt a lot more, about computers, programming and electronics. Thus one of my first major project came about, ScooterStats. It was made using an ESP32 and some electronic components to add internet of things integration to my electric scooter. The code is free to view and use on Github.

                    <p>
                    Another one of my favorite projects was designing PBBs to house an ESP32 microcontroller. The PCB went through 3 iterations, each time becoming more refined and compact. The image to the left is the third iteration and final iteration of this design. 
                    <br><br>
                    I designed it using EasyEDA, a web based electronics design software. The miniscule components were hand placed using tweezers and soldered on with a heat gun.

                    <div class="subtitle">FPV Drones</div>
                    <p>The drone is the picture is an FPV or first person view drone. It's flown by looking through the feed transmitted from the onboard camera. This was a really fun project that I still work on to this day. I had to build the drone completely from scratch, starting with chooosing the right components, to soldering them on, to configuring the flight control software (Betaflight). This project really improved my soldering skills by leaps and bounds thanks to all the tiny pads and wires.

                    <div class="subtitle">3D Printed Phone Storage</div>
                    <p>This 3D modeled and 3D printed phone storage was made as a solution to a simple problem I saw. During my last year of highschool I saw that the phones submitted during the start of the day were placed and stores is a very dangerous pile. 
                    <br><br>
                    Thus I saw it as an opportunity to refine my 3D modeling skills as well as some extremly simple woodworking for the base. Overall the design works well, and is still used by my former highschool.
